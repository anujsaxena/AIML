        "# **File Handling**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you’re working with Python, you don’t need to import a library in order to read and write files. It’s handled natively in the language, albeit in a unique manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing you’ll need to do is use Python’s built-in open function to get a file object. \n",
        "\n",
        "The open function opens a file. It’s simple. \n",
        "\n",
        "When you use the open function, it returns something called a file object. File objects contain methods and attributes that can be used to collect information about the file you opened. They can also be used to manipulate said file.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the mode attribute of a file object tells you which mode a file was opened in. And the name attribute tells you the name of the file that the file object has opened. \n",
        "\n",
        "You must understand that a file and file object are two wholly separate – yet related – things.\n",
        " \n",
        "**File Types**\n",
        "\n",
        "What you may know as a file is slightly different in Python. \n",
        "In Windows, for example, a file can be any item manipulated, edited or created by the user/OS. That means files can be images, text documents, executables, and much more. Most files are organized by keeping them in individual folders. \n",
        "In Python, a file is categorized as either text or binary, and the difference between the two file types is important. \n",
        "Text files are structured as a sequence of lines, where each line includes a sequence of characters. This is what you know as code or syntax. \n",
        "Each line is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line character. There are several types, but the most common is the comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. \n",
        "A backslash character can also be used, and it tells the interpreter that the next character – following the slash – should be treated as a new line. This character is useful when you don’t want to start a new line in the text itself but in the code. \n",
        "A binary file is any type of file that is not a text file. Because of their nature, binary files can only be processed by an application that know or understand the file’s structure. In other words, they must be applications that can read and interpret binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Open ( ) Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to open a file for writing or use in Python, you must rely on the built-in open () function. \n",
        "As explained above, open ( ) will return a file object, so it is most commonly used with two arguments.  \n",
        "An argument is nothing more than a value that has been provided to a function, which is relayed when you call it. So, for instance, if we declare the name of a file as “Test File,” that name would be considered an argument. \n",
        "The syntax to open a file object in Python is:\n",
        "\n",
        "*File_object = open(\"filename\",\"mode\")*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mode**\n",
        "\n",
        "Including a mode argument is optional because a default value of ‘r’ will be assumed if it is omitted. The ‘r’ value stands for read mode, which is just one of many. \n",
        "The modes are: \n",
        "1.\t‘r’ – Read mode which is used when the file is only being read \n",
        "2. ‘w’ – Write mode which is used to edit and write new information to the file (any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated) \n",
        "3.\t‘a’ – Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically appended to the end \n",
        "4.\t‘r+’ – Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file \n"

            "Public Relations(PR) in Media\n",
            "Public Relations(PR) in media is defined as the practice of deliberately managing the release and spread of information between an individual or an organization(such as business, government agency, or nonprofit organization) and the public.\n",
            "Strategies used for Public Relations(PR)\n",
            "1)Developing Relations with Media and Influncers-  by interacting with journalists, media outlets, and influencers on social media they extend the public relationship beyond the press release pitch. This increases the chances of gaining media coverage with right outlets.\n",
            "2)Facilitate the Brand Message through Content Distribution- by distributing original and branded content audience is a tried and true social media tactic. In addition, it allows public relations teams to strategically facilitate the brand message online. By having control of the type of content shared, and the copywriting within the post, PR pros ensure the proper brand message is sent each time.\n",
            "3)Incorporate Social Sharing into Press Release- A simple, yet effective way to integrate social media into a public relations campaign is by adding social sharing capabilities to press releases. This allows readers and media outlets to distribute your intended message online in seconds.Embedding relevant social media links and posts into your press releases also promotes social sharing and engagement among readers.\n",
            "4)Create and Leverage Campaign Hashtags- Hashtags, while initially used to follow conversations online, can be a strategic tool for public relations objectives. By creating and leveraging specific campaign hashtags on social media platforms.\n",
            "PR teams can accomplish the following:\n",
            "Monitor customer conversations centered around the particular campaign\n",
            "Understand how the campaign is performing among intended audiences\n",
            "Engage in user/customer conversations online\n",
            "Ensure campaign and brand content is easily searchable.\n",
            "\n",
            "5)Holding Media Events- Hold a press conference or a media junket whenever you have something important to announce. These events will give the media a chance to ask questions in a way that a press release does not. Thus, help build a more robust story on your business. Use the opportunity to further build in some time for journalists to talk one-on-one with your partners, customers and staff. Schedule the event to suit the media’s deadlines and always consult with them beforehand.\n",
            "6)Real Time Crisis Management- Public relations professionals are responsible for extinguishing all online crises that may lead to a negative brand reputation. Social media platforms allow brands, and PR teams alike, to respond in real-time to situations and/or customer conversations. With the growing ability for customers to interact directly with brands online, PR teams must take advantage of the “instant” nature of social media to tackle crises and maintain a positive online reputation for the brand.\n",
            "7)Get Organised- PR is achieved through a planned, sustained set of activities. You will need a calendar to organize your outreach activities. You must also start generating a contact list of media, opinion leaders, personalities, customers and likeminded companies to engage and collaborate with.\n",
            "8)Enhancing Online Presence- In this world where everyone is digitally connected you need an online presence to reach to your customers. Your “social media presence”. Facebook, Instagram, twitter are great mediums to reach your public. You can use them to make announcements, make connections and publish content.\n",
            "9)Create Compelling content- Public relations is about sharing the right information to the right places and people. This helps build your brand and brand reputation. You need to learn your target language, desires, things that resonate with them, and the things they don’t like. Choose the right topic for your content. Compelling content should include elements of curiosity, urgency, relevancy, value and emotion.\n",
            "10)Working with a Team- Your team will help you add value to your messaging, provide feedback and help you distribute your messages. A team can help ensure that any messages you convey are by design rather than an accident.\n",
